Project Description: The code under development creates a list of anime titles, sorting them by name, genre (action, comedy, adventure, etc.),
and rating (rated between 0 and 10 using only whole numbers). The list of anime is then stored in a file to be read later.
Future implementations include adding a system to separate different users and indicate anime titles according to those present in their list.

Functional Requirements: The project must meet the following preferences, currently implemented in the terminal itself.

Prompt the user to enter the name of an anime.

Prompt for the type of anime.

Request a rating for the anime.

Ask the user if they want to add a new anime and if yes, repeat the above actions.

Record the information regarding the anime in a file.

Read the file containing information regarding the anime and display it to the user.

*Future implementations should include the ability for each file to be associated with a specific user and provide 
recommendations based on the anime titles in their lists.
